# Teledetection
The main objective of this project was to implement the FMask algorithm in python on satellite images of French Guiana from the GOES-16 satellite. 
Because it mainly applies to Landsat images in the original paper *(« Object-based cloud detection and cloud shadow detection in Landsat imagery », Zhe Zhu, Curtic E. Woodcock)*, the bands of GOES-16 had to be converted to an equivalent so that we could apply the algorithm.
